# Clickable Thumbnail Enhancement

## Overview
Made thumbnail images in fox report emails clickable, allowing users to directly access the event video by clicking on the thumbnail image.

## User Experience

### Before
- Thumbnail images were static
- Users had to click the separate [Event] link to view the video

### After  
- Clicking on the thumbnail image opens the event video
- More intuitive interaction - users naturally want to click on images
- [Event] link still available as backup option

## Implementation Details

### HTML Changes
- Wrapped thumbnail `<img>` tags in `<a>` anchor tags
- Link points to the same event video URL as the [Event] button
- Added `title` attribute with hover tooltip: "Click to view event video"

### Visual Feedback
Added CSS for user interaction feedback:
- **Cursor**: Changes to pointer on hover
- **Hover Effect**: Thumbnail slightly enlarges (scale 1.05)
- **Shadow**: Increases on hover to show interactivity
- **Smooth Transition**: 0.2s animation for professional feel

### Code Example
```html
<a href="https://frig.mso.mt/api/events/{event_id}/clip.mp4" title="Click to view event video">
    <img src="cid:image0@frigate" class="thumbnail" alt="Fox detection thumbnail">
</a>
```

### CSS Enhancements
```css
.thumbnail {
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: transform 0.2s, box-shadow 0.2s;
}
.thumbnail:hover {
    transform: scale(1.05);
    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved UX**: More intuitive - users expect images to be clickable
2. **Faster Access**: One less click to view the video
3. **Visual Feedback**: Hover effect clearly indicates interactivity
4. **Redundancy**: Both thumbnail and [Event] link go to the same video
5. **Mobile Friendly**: Works well on touch devices

## Compatibility

- **Gmail**: ✅ Full support for clickable images
- **Outlook**: ✅ Full support
- **Apple Mail**: ✅ Full support
- **Mobile Clients**: ✅ Tap to open video

## User Workflow

1. Open fox report email
2. See thumbnail of fox detection
3. Click/tap directly on the thumbnail
4. Video opens in browser/player

This creates a more natural and efficient workflow for reviewing fox detections.
